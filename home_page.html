    <p id="about-us-description">The "Prior" is an online organizing application which can help people to stay on top of all they have to do. It's easy to forget, get discouraged, and not accomplish all the things you have set for yourself. The Prior allows you to create tasks to help you keep track of what you have to do. There are three different ways you can view your tasks; by day, by week, and by month. But what makes the Prior different from just a normal calendar? Well, tasks can be filtered by what category they fall under, allowing users to visualize what things they need to do in particular fields. In addition, you can give each task an importance, symbolizing the urgency of the task. The tasks are color-coded based on their importances, with the least important tasks being white, and the most important tasks being red.</p>
